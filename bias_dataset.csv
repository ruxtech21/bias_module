"You may have to forgive liberals being a little hysterical, but Trump has said a lot of racist and insensitive things. It's funny how character, morals, the things a person says, the views a person has seemed to matter so much just a short time ago! It seems it didn't take much to jettison these ideals from the minds of religious and conservative voters. Racist things Trump has said are easy to find:
 “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks,”

If that is the case, almost every one of us, including me, would be subject to being banned from somewhere.

"Well said about Sir John, surely the greatest and certainly the most essential prime minister this country ever had.

I think it is close to treason that the hyper-partisan Liberals are removing MacDonald from the $10 bill in 2018 to substitute a black woman from Nova Scotia whose sole claim to fame is that she once refused to sit in the upper balcony of a theatre which banned blacks from sitting on the first level and spent overnight in jail and paid a $25 fine (in 1946).

This woman was wrongly treated and a case can be made that she is the Canadian version of Rosa Parks and she deserves to be appropriately honoured.  

But to remove the father of our country rather than another PM on some other bill because he was a Conservative and this ties in with Junior`s design to con low information voters that Canada did not really begin until his old man took power in 1968 is simply beyond the pale.

The Kim dynasty is paranoid but not stupid, and its longtime grip on power shows there is a logic to its actions.

If the US has decided not to allow a missile threat to the homeland, a limited strike would not be wise.  The North would surely retaliate, perhaps by attacking Japanese bases as a way of stirring up Korean nationalism.  Then what?

Funny you seem unaware that illegally obtained firearms include those stolen from law enforcement personnel (think recently of both Honolulu and San Francisco), military members, some smuggled from overseas (Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East) as well as some made by people with access to common machine shop tools such as drill presses and lathes (and 3-D printers if you've been keeping up with current events). 

You also seem ignorent of history and that guns have been made under conditions of severe scrutiny and hardship.  Resistance movements all over Europe and even in the Warsaw Ghetto built many and quite deadly firearms.  These guns may not have been very durable, but they didn't need to be to kill an Axis soldier and take his weapons.

It is the administrators of these schools that have now become so brazen as to not even try to hide their real political goals as they have been doing from the naive public. Sad, they are using the children for their political goals.
Most alarming is that OHA is funding schools, no matter on which side of sovereignty question they are on(either wanting to become an Indian Tribe or have a Complete Break with the U.S.) both roads lead to the same place. Therefore, OHA is funding the sovereignty movement.
BTW, propaganda metastasizes in children's brains. Racism towards ""others"", anger, a hyper sense of self, super egos, and violently acting out may not begin to show until mid to late teenage years. Regardless of the sovereignty activism training, racial school segregation, by it's very nature, will also produce these outcomes.",1

Illegal aliens are a problem whose time has come to be addressed.

While strikes may have been rare 30 or more years ago, their data show it's happening more often and may not even be classified as ""rare"".   

My anecdotal observation about lightening in SC Alaska is it's more common than it used to be along with the type of storms that produce lightening more than in the 70's. There is a web site that show lightening strikes and counts on an hourly basis.Their data shows a marked increase in lightening strike across the state yearly, breaking records almost every year since they put the satellites in place.

1.) If AGW is not real and we only think it's real because of an airtight scientific conspiracy against the truth, why wouldn't a fossil fuel company fund its own research to reveal the truth? Exxon or BP could spend tens of millions to fund and publicize such research, and they have a LOT to lose unless AGW is shown to be a hoax. Hell, they spend more than that funding denial!

2.) GW theory is important to a wide range of scientific disciplines--atmospheric physics and chemistry, paleontology, oceanography, climatology, the study of glaciers and ice, even the study of other planets. The scientists who showed that atmospheric CO2 was not, in fact, the Earth's' thermostat, would be the Newton or Einstein of our age. She or he would redefine our knowledge of the universe. That is one hell of an inducement to do the research, especially if AGW theory is so clearly a fraud.

You also know that this stat still means 20% of those murdered by their spouses were men, right? Are we really in the business of telling those 20 they can't get a bed because there's likely 80 women also out there in their situation, somewhere in the country, that matter more?

While Israelis will tell you that their justice system treats non-Israelis like everyone else, that's not true. Were a Palestinian to have committed the same offence against an Israeli soldier, the charge and conviction would've been murder.

An apartheid nation has the same criminal laws for everyone, ostensibly. But what happens is that the law is APPLIED differently depending on the perpetrator and victim. For example, under South African apartheid if a black South African killed a white South African, the charge and sentence would be more severe. Vice versa if a white killed a black.

And to be frank, unlike the Peel kids' observances, the subject matter of our little gatherings often operated well-outside any mainstream cultural norms. I certainly don't imagine any of the Peel kids' modern-day (and teacher vetted) sermons delve into Satanic-rock-music conspiracy theories or promoting wildly regressive sexual politics like my Christian discussion groups did back in the day.

"The Supreme Court of Canada gave us a trilogy of cases may years ago which set an indexed maximum cap for general damages for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life.

This number is understood to be the compensation for the ""worst"" injury one can suffer--which is generally understood to be quadriplegia in a younger person.  Extra damages are available if the injury requires nursing care, loss of earning ability, and similar amounts for losses or expenses caused by the incident.  It is exceptional in Canada for injured persons to win millions of dollars---if they do, the injuries are severe.  Now look at Mr. Khadr.  His experience, the Supreme Court said violated his rights, we have to accept that.

What that reporting oscillation means is that the editors recognize that the glass is half full and half empty with the recent month's numbers, and viewers (and editors, in a vacillating fashion hour-to-hour) are able to emphasize either side.

This all started when the racist, BLM cop hater Kaepernick wore socks with cartoon pigs wearing police uniforms. BLM is a parade of lies. Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown were both killed during violent assaults. Hands up don't shoot was a huge lie.

If BLM and their uninformed followers really cared about black lives, they would be marching through the big city ghettos trying to stop blacks from slaughtering other blacks. See Chicago. A black person in America is more likely to be killed by other black person than any other group, BY FAR. And cops are more likely to be killed by blacks than the other way around.

Yes, ""we must begin to see and hear with supernatural eyes and ears."" 

But in order to do so, in order to set the stage for the possibility of actually hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit guiding us to see and hear as Jesus sees and hears what we encounter around us, the struggles within the Church, and the world, we need two things, I suggest.

First, we need an open mind. God's ways are not our ways, and from this it follows that if we see and hear and understand what Jesus sees and hears and understands, we would be perpetually surprised.  We can pretty much count on it that what we see and hear and understand on our own, our instinctive perspective, our jumping to conclusions, our instinctive analyses of all situations, is NOT what Jesus sees and hears and understands.

Second, we need to be well practiced in the art of taking the perspective of the other. We need to be able to grasp that there are always more than one way to see, hear and understand every situation.",0

"I want to make a small point here. The term ""racism"" has some serious limitations. In general use, it clumsily describes sentiments.  But we must note that sentiments alone do not cause material harm. Harm is caused when we take actions of one sort or another. This gap between feeling and action makes it possible to do great harm, without harboring any hostile sentiments, and, conversely to do good, though one may harbor contempt. Harms are material, and measurable. Sentiments, not so much. We tend to imagine that when sentiments are sufficiently positive, that will lead to a reduction in harm, but this sets the struggle in terms that are largely subjective, and maintain a narcissistic focus on White people, and our feelings. Innumerable idiotic disputes about feelings ensue.  The proper sentiment to cultivate is actually a zeal for justice. Justice may be argued in material, measurable terms.  It may be pursued in court, and by the officials elected to do our will.  (cont.)",1

You don't mention higher Meth sentences that exist for the same reason but affect whites and Hispanics.  Why not?  Don't you want justice for all?

The Congressional Record shows in 1986, when the strict, federal anti-crack legislation was first being debated, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC)deeply concerned about the degree to which crack was decimating black communities across the United States—strongly supported the legislation and actually pressed for even harsher penalties. A few years earlier, CBC members pushed Pres. Reagan to create the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

It should  be noted that the vast majority of cocaine arrests in the U.S. are made at the state-not the federal—level, where sentencing disparities between cases involving crack and powder cocaine generally have never existed.",1

After the Civil War many white business owners in the South demanded sex for employment from black women.

I do not believe it is your opinion; I believe you simply are parroting what the anti-Trump media says.  It may interest you to know the EO was not shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional. The court’s ruling applies only to immigrants who were already in the U.S. or on their way here when Trump signed the EO.

"I am in fact old enough to remember when only white males were first class citizens. I was born in 1949. Throughout the 50s and 60s women and minorities were openly discriminated against in employment. Very few women held public office. Blacks were kept from voting throughout the south and were unable to buy housing in places like Eugene, Oregon. As late as the late 50s people as prominent as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald could not get a hotel room in Eugene.

As for homosexuality, that was more likely to get you jail than matrimony.",1

"I'm surprised (smirk) G&M readers are not more informed.  Racism-generally understood as antipathy, prejudice, discrimination against people based on 'race', which most take as phenotypic characteristics -skin colour (no biological basis for race beyond that) and a belief that one's race is superior.  Thus, it can be argued that a racialised person who believes him/herself to be superior to a white person could be said to be racist.  What makes white racism pernicious  is power, which whites inarguably have held throughout history, and which is inherent in western social/political/economic systems that has been promulgated through colonialism, (cultural) imperialism etc.  Whites may not have a monopoly on racism but they benefit from racist systems/practices and they have the power to negatively affect the lives of racialised groups.  I'd argue that in most places on the planet whiteness=privileged status.  Doesnt mean whites dont have problems/hard lives, imagine all that + racism.",1

But to portray this as the mainstream view in this country, as this writer does, is wrong. It is not. We've lived all over this country, in big cities and small towns. Racism is not endemic. But it is certainly endemic in media coverage. Over the past century, new immigrant groups - whether they were Irish, Italian, Pakistanis, German or Poles - have almost invariably been subjected to verbal abuse, derogatory jokes, and unfair stereotypes - but over time, they overcame it, stood up for themselves, built new lives, and were accepted. That doesn't make any of this okay, or acceptable. The world (shock, horror) has never been an entirely fair or equitable place. But to obsess about such inequities and magnify them as the central truth of a country like Canada is simplistic and inaccurate, IMHO.",1

Over the years, I have worked with people of many ethnic origins, all having the quality that they didn't see themselves as of any particular ethnicity.  From the inside looking out, I can't see myself, just as they couldn't see themselves.  It was this attitude that made us compatible co-workers.  In fact, this essay had me to consciously recall my former co-workers, to recall what they even looked like to see if they fit the label of ""ethnically diverse"".

I suggest that this author try to wind back the clock to the 4-year age and start over.  The way we act influences the way people react.",1

We might want to talk about how Ratzinger abused the concept of ""ordinary magisterium"" to draw the false conclusion that it is infallibly true that we may not ordain women priests. 

This is an awful lot to talk about here, most of it in one way or another implying that V1's definition of papal infallibility is beyond doubt one of the most fooling things bishops in council have ever done.",0

First, it in a fact of life, that blacks, on average, have significantly, lower IQs than Whites. Then the problems associated with  low average IQ of Blacks, is compounded by their collective  tendency to drop out of school early, & to be disruptive to the learning environment, while in school.  Then add to this, the common use of foul language, & their manner of dress, with their pants down below their butts, & their tendency towards violent crime Blacks, by their behavior & poor attitudes, are the cause of their, generally low level of achievement in America.

We already know what the academic left and much of the cultural elite believe. But Canadians as a whole have not been invited to openly debate this vital issue.

IF whites in north america/europe are so privileged and racist why do so many people wish to immigrate into these societies they constructed over millenia (Europe) or at least since the enlightenment in North America?

The role of inflammatory cytokines as neuro-modulators in the infant medulla has been well described and is likely the reason for “a significant number of SIDS deaths” occurring in conjunction with mild infection.

The Generals pointed out that they will never fight alongside the Russians because they cannot be trusted, they alert the US to where they will be and go elsewhere, including bombing US supported troops. They note Russia supports Assad and bombs his enemies and not ISIS, we bombed Assad who uses chemical weapons with the help of Russia, and Russia is courting Iran to get bases that will give Russia air superiority in the region (they have flown missions from Iran bases that Russia wants on a permanent basis).",0

Really disappointed to watch a 2-hour PBS show about Lyndon Johnson and learn that there was NO attack on an American ship in the Tonkin Gulf. It was raining hard and the radar was just showing a lot of static. So they decided to shoot everything they had at everything and anything. The next morning there was no evidence of debris or oil slinks. They make a mistake. Johnson was running for re-election and was tired of Goldwater calling him a coward. So he bull-lied and said we were attacked and took the opportunity to declare was and win re-election. What a bastardo.

"Harper took on the CBC...cut it to pieces.
The CBC uncovered multiple scandals under the CONS while in office.
There journalists are top notch and we owe them a dept of gratitude for uncovering government corruption. ie The Senate, Duffy, Election Fraud. Six deficits. the list is endless.
Crown corporations, (especially the CBC) require ""arms length"" government interference.

Then one of them brought out their IPod or something and started blasting rap music loudly. When the park ranger who was nearby came and told them to quiet down. She was immediately backed by several other hikers who told the teens to respect where they were but instead, the teens responded by saying that the ranger was a racist and disrespecting them on how they can behave. Then one of the mothers of the teens showed up asking why teens can't have fun. Ranger told her that screaming at the top of their voices and blasting music is disrespectful to others up and down the canyon but even that mother had no clue why it was so disrespectful to others.

The social costs from alcohol are staggering (absenteeism, reduced productivity, violence, accidents, health care, etc, etc), but recreational use of the drug is completely accepted. And governments tax the heck out of it. There's no logic to the current way we think about ""drugs"".

What's missing from the discussion is serious consideration of demand. WHY do so many people want whatever a drug gives them? To self-medicate for physical or mental health issues? To ""escape"" from miserable circumstances? ""Just for fun""? Let's have a serious discussion of why the demand exists in the first place, and formulate public policy that focuses on demand reduction and harm reduction.",0

You are confusing cause and effect. Britain colonised (looted) Asia and Africa BECAUSE it was the birthplace of the industrialized world and not the way around as you put it when you wrote ‘The UK is the birthplace of the industrialized world, because it looted Asia and Africa.’

Britain and other European nations were able to discover and subdue most of the globe because of processes that were native to Europe, only and nowhere else, principally Western Europe. The Age of Enlightenment gave rise to the Industrial Revolution which built on the scientific discoveries and technological advances made during the Enlightenment. There is no definite dating but Enlightenment started around 1650 as a rule.

The Industrial Revolution was a transition to a modern manufacturing (think guns, ships, advanced tools) and took place from 1760 to 1820. Most historians agree it started in Britain, mainly, and spread to the rest of Europe.",0

The next morning, he was dragged before the Emperor's court. ""How dare you,"" bellowed the Emperor, ""lay hand on my royal steed! Jailor, put this thief to death!"" 
Immediately, the thief bowed deeply. ""Your judgement is peerless and wise, O Emperor,"" he calmly replied, ""but my life is of little value. I should offer you a gift before I depart. Your mount is quite a fine one, but if your eminence would spare my life for just a year and a day, I swear to you I can teach that horse to sing.  To the surprise of all, the Emperor quickly accepted the offer.
The jailor whispered to the thief, ""You are a fool!"" You will be tortured when you fail.
"" I am a fool?"" Much can happen in a year and a day. The King may die. The horse may die. I may die... and maybe the horse will learn how to sing.""",1

"Actually, the trend I've seen in here is that ADN regularly prints photos of non-white offenders but frequently doesn't when the ""perp"" is white--so much so it's usually a safe bet if no photo accompanies a crime-piece when a suspect's identity is known, that he's from up in the melanistically-challenged section of the bleachers.

I recall one online edition last year when an article about a white child-molester--in custody--lacked a photo was juxtaposed against that of a Native child-molester which included both him and his wife (who wasn't charge with any crime).

Having said that, I find it absolutely hilarious that several posters insisted on arguing the suspect wasn't white, even after the police artist's sketch was published.  Apparently they're so fixated on their fears of ""scary black/brown people"" they deny the evidence of their own eyes.  Like those who keep shrieking and flailing Colin Kaepernick is a ""radical Muslim"" despite repeated reports he's a devout Christian.

"Your stats stink. They're old and stale. They don't count. If you think white makes might and white makes right, think again. 

From Lisa Bloom. ""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest, most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" 

Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

"Yep, still on the path: “(We) are seeking to assist the white race toward the elimination of the unfit (blacks).” (Birth Control and Racial Betterment, 1919)

“We are paying for and submitting to an ever increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings (blacks) who never should have been born at all. That our wealth is being diverted from the progress of human civilization … Our eyes should be opened to the terrific cost to the community of this dead weight of (black) human waste.” (The Pivot of Civilization, 1922)

“Birth control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks–those human weeds (blacks) which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.” (New York Times interview, 1923)

"It seems Mr. Northrup wants to enjoy his white privilege without any repercussions from African Americans or other people of color. He doesn't seem to realize that people who are oppressed simply because of the color of their skin might rebel, and that it might manifest as confrontation and/or retaliation from time to time. That, actually, is pretty understandable.

If he doesn't like being graced with white privilege because he was born white in a country dominated and controlled by and mainly for white people, I'd like to ask him if he would gladly trade places with a black person.  Lane County is almost 83% white, so it's somewhat rare that acts of discrimination against minorities occur, just by virtue of proportionality, but it definitely happens.

"Why not cast a white singer in this role? Two reasons: (a) It's still not a level playing field for performers of colour, anywhere. That's just an easily proven statistical fact. If we don't want our stages to be a Whites-Only Zone, it makes sense to give a job to a singer of colour when that role is specifically written for a singer of colour. It will further that singer's career; inspire future singers of colour to say, ""Hey, I could do this""; and expose audiences to the talent of artists of colour, which can make people just a bit more imaginative and empathetic. (b) SOUTH PACIFIC is about a white woman who can't bear the thought of mixing the races. Race is a major plot point. If Bloody Mary is black, Asian, or a First Nations mezzo like BC's Marion Newman (who was wonderful in GIIWEDIN a few years ago), we'll still get the basic story...

Second - Mark will be able to leverage this within the catholic Texas bishops group that meets regularly - thus, bishops from Laredo, Brownsville, San Angelo can also leverage.
Third, all TX bishops have the TX Senate Bill 4 fears and are struggling to organize and articulate to their parishes.

BTW, if my head were in the sand, I would not have supported those who protested against neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlotte, nor supported the removal of Confederate monuments.

"51% probability is not very high. The IPCC for instance, rates the probability that human activity is warming the planet at 95% or ""highly likely"". Science is always trying to increase the probability of its findings. If an hypothesis won't consistently support a high level of probability it will be discarded.

And again, you're leaving time out of your reasoning. Time allows for greater numbers of data to accumulate and be studied. A single ENSO is relatively short term. Short term projections tend to be obscured by what statisticians call ""noise"", the natural variability in a given system. Introducing time into the equation tends to sort out the ""signal"" from the noise. 

You also leave out the paleoclimate, such as the Vostok ice cores from Antarctica and other proxy records, such as the tree rings in which Michael Mann found evidence that the current warming is anomalous over the last 2000 years. You know these, right?  The past is prologue in climate too.

True.  And yet most of the schisms, or schismatic-like movements, at least in the past three hundred years, have come from the right.  As the letter from the four cardinals first made its way into the news (not that the average Catholic in the pew knows or cares about it), I thought it unlikely that it would lead to a schism. I still think it unlikely: Burke can do the math and he knows that he's young enough to be an elector at the next conclave, and I doubt that he will do anything to complicate that.  Yet, it seems clear that his ego has engaged, and it's impossible to say for sure where that will lead.

As for emigration to China's polluted cities, a majority of Chinese PhD students in the USA go back to China. Because they get better jobs there. Shanghai has more billionaires now than New York. A lot of the rich Chinese investors come to Canada for their citizenship, and then move back to China (or Hong Kong, in the 1990s). 

As for being bombed, why not pick the example of Afghanistan or Iraq or Somalia? They remain at the bottom of several socio-economic indices. So it is not American bombing that determines a country's future, it is the hard work and intelligence of their citizens and leaders.",0

And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it. 

Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles.

"White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson 

Carol Anderson is an African American academic. She is the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University. Her research focuses on public policy with regards to race, justice, and equality. Anderson and I share the premise that white rage is a historical affliction that started with the birth of America. Slavery. The ""winning"" of the West that included wanton murders of Native Americans. 

She adds that white rage is a drug, where like those in Charlottesville, nothing else mattered except the induced feelings of superiority by White Supremacists. They were all out in the open, no masks, no hoods, with identities revealed. That didn't matter. Some may have lost their jobs as a result. But did that matter? No.

It isn't like the Constitution hasn't been picked apart, studied and researched by numerous political science academics, lawyers, judges, etc. or that we have any writings about the Constitution like the Federalists Papers or even any judgments based upon Constitutional review, eg. Marbury v. Madison, that were provided by people who helped frame the Constitution at the time which all conform with common usage of the English language.  No!  We should ignore all factual and customary bases and go with YOUR ""sort of 1700s English."" Let's not refer to any of these records that you seem blithely ignorant of and just go with your judgment of what the Constitution ""was meant to be.""[/sarcasm]

"The history of this state began about 15,000 years ago, according to current evidence.  All but the last millimeter or two of that long timeline belongs to Native peoples--who didn't subscribe to your Boys' Life myth about ""rugged individualists hacking a life out of the wilderness.""  Traditional Native communities believed (and to some extent still believe today) that survival is a shared enterprise.  A man was proud to share his good fortune with the group; equally, a man stayed with his group during hard times.  He didn't run off and take care of his own ass while they suffered.  You whites may do it differently, but I can't see that you've got much to brag about.  Your budget deficit, after all, was made by your own stupid and greedy every-man-for-himself white politics, not according to Native values.",1

"M. Bessoudo: "" ... It is absurd to connect jihadi violence by a British citizen to a “feeling of cultural dislocation.” A feeling of cultural dislocation is wholly insufficient to explain the full character of jihadi violence ...""

As a teen age immigrant to Canada and interested observer of the cultural transition:

Immigrant communities tend to daydream about a past in their home lands that never was, indeed a cultural superiority - regret for being forced to emigrate. Many consider returning to their home lands until a dose of reality intervenes. This aspect of family life is transmitted to their children, encouraged as a sense of superiority to the locals. Thus the achievement of citizenship, or being born here, is merely superficial window dressing. It requires a revolt against traditional family values to enable immigrant children to integrate into our society. The same issue may be said to apply to our FN youth from remote reserves who leave reserves for educational reasons.",0

"Actually, Mike, the destruction of the ""black family"" began with the actions of Woodrow Wilson, and his own support of the original goal of planned parenthood, within that said original goal was to eliminate the black ""race"".

Between the end of our own civil war, and the beginning of Wilson's term, 'race' relations were improving unto the extent that ANY individual, regardless of pigment, was allowed to achieve, through their own merits, whatever success they could muster within their own efforts.

And then came along Woodrow Wilson, a racist, a eugenist, and guess what, a Democrat, just as all the prominent Democrats before him.

The ones that founded the KKK.

The ones that fought against freedom unto blacks.

I know that this is no longer taught within public education, as it is not politically correct, but it is nonetheless true.

It is the Democrat, or Liberal mind-set that denigrates those of what 'they' deem as a 'minority', and expect, without question, their support.

Only a neophyte or a rube would suggest that an editorial does not carry the personal bias of its author. Writing for the majority does not connote unanimity in a deadline environment, except to the uninformed or, unfortunately for the rest of us, those too romanced by their own ""influence"" to recognize how and when to stop spreading ""it.""",0
"Thank you Mr. Beltrami for this unique take on how the new Senate bill to repeal and replace the ACA will effect even those lucky enough to still have insurance once the after repeal devastation is assessed. I do hope that you and Senator French are in communication with Lisa and Dan( no-one knows where Don is anymore) and that they pay heed to your warnings. Also repealed in the GOP bills is the no lifetime or yearly limit allowed anymore under the ACA. If you have ever know someone who has had the grievous misfortune to have needed chemo therapy you know how quickly One Million and the cutoff is reached. Before the ACA medical bankruptcy was the number one cause of financial ruin in America because those yearly/lifetime limits were reached. The ""recision"" clause whereby it was entirely legal for an insurance corps to cancel you policy once you needed care was also done away with. Under the new bill that is all back along with higher deductibles and premiums. This bill is a loser. SAD",0

Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

In vaudeville, the stock character ""Jim Crow"" was a disruptive clown in blackface who disrupted ""polite"" white actors in public places, like hotels, restaurants, trains and ships. Blackface has largely disappeared from our entertainment media, and so a lot of people have forgotten that it is mockery as used by our culture. But, Black people (not ""liberals"" per se) haven't forgotten and it's not surprising that Black college students are smart and educated enough to be offended. Calling the offense a ""liberal elite"" phenomenon also implies that ""conservative hoi polloi"" haven't got the savvy to recognize blackface as mockery; so in effect you are calling those people stupid and crude.

The offense of blackface is to those who are mocked, African Americans, and not directed toward the ""liberal elite"", toward ""elites"" or toward ""liberals"".",1

DEED: 2006 $830M, 2016 $1.302B — 31% ABOVE inflation

<<On a scale of zero to ten, with ten being a videotape of Trump speaking in Russian to his handlers from the Kremlin, like Kevin Costner in the last scene in No Way Out, we’re currently at about 7.5. Trump repeatedly demanded loyalty from the FBI director, asked that he halt his investigation into the Russia scandal, instructed other intelligence officials to pressure him to end the investigation — the precise action that forced Richard Nixon to resign — and then fired Comey for refusing to do so. Many of his associates have been caught lying about their meetings and financial ties with Russia and what they said at those meetings....>>

In taking the staff contributions government promised they would make up any future deficit. This they would probably like to forget today.

In the late 19th century, British and Americans were preferred, followed by northern and western Europeans, central and eastern Europeans and then by Jews and southern Europeans. Religious sects such as Hutterites and Mennonites or Doukhobors were less wanted and Asians and Blacks were almost unacceptable. People displaced by WWII were seen as dirty DP's who were bringing crime to Canada.

The left doesn't judge by the content of character. It's all about reverse racism. If it's black it's supported. The lunatic left has a pro-black bias. Even the cop hating criminal thugs who claim to be victims. The left judges by color. If it's black they get all loopy. And what's with commenting about Trump's color all the time?

Those of us with a modicum of understanding of economics understand that resource extraction IS the driver of the Alaskan economy.

Walker is trying to reduce the size of the government by shifting State services into the private market. It's about time.

Alaskans cannot live on pixie dust or the leavings of the out-of-state tourism industry that uses Alaska as their zoo and expects Alaskans to act as exhibits in that zoo.

The reason is that the symbols on Synagogues and Mosques do not confront evil, as the cross of Jesus Christ is an emblem of Truth and been so confronts evil, as it bears witness to the Truth, the essence of ‘love’ of neighbour, and in doing so often antagonizes the sensibilities of innate knowledge known within the human heart.
The serving of the Truth is Love, and to know Jesus Christ, this must be truly understood.

Also, both sides need to understand that the relationship between the Producers and the State will not be the same in these times of fiscal constraint.

"""First prove your contention that a baker has to make a kkk cake.""
Your reply does it for me. In my state of California gay marriage bills have been defeated on every occasion (although I have voted in favor of them). It was made legal by a Federal judge not the will of the people. Therefore the argument can be made that gay marriage is offensive to most people. Therefore the contention that the KKK are offensive to most people becomes irrelevant. Therefore if the ACLU is successful in this case, all someone would have to do when the go to this black baker (just to be evil to him) is order a cake with the Grand Cyclops of the KKK on it...claim they were gay and therefore protected and watch with incredible glee as this black business owner has to submit...under the law...to decorate this Alt-Right guys cake with this heinous image on it.

High power rifle rounds can go for miles.  If the woman was hit at a distance of a mile, it is not surprising that the shooters did not hear her cries for help.  It is surprising to me that she was hit with multiple rounds since at distance that would require very high precision shooting.  If the shooting was at short range, more serious charges may have been warranted.

"Interesting thought, considering the primary reason for rejecting the status in the first place is because they essentially  glorify a sense of  inaquality that many believe still exist in the United States. And while Lincoln may have rejected the concept of slavery, he also did not believe other races were the equal of white Europeans.  One quote of many from Lincoln:

""I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”

What do you really know about sectarian conflicts in India? Does it stem from the assumption that the East is more barbaric and uncivilized? Hinduism and Buddhism have a far better record on religious tolerance than Christianity.

The rhetoric might continue to heat up, but what will be telling is what NK actually does in terms of tests and missiles. 

When it comes to NK, nothing else has worked so far and there are no good military or regime-change options. Trump seems to have a wonderful grasp of creating and sustaining drama -- maybe that's exactly what's needed here. He needs a win and this would be a big one -- keeping the lid on NK.

You can't and won't ""*statistics*"" your way out of the fact that the vast majority of how blacks are raised in this country is broken, and if you speciously think that a black man dropping by once a month to see their child is tantamount to *""being active in their children's lives,""* then you are regrettably mistaken.

It is far easier for social justice warriors to tell whites *they* are the problem when nothing could be further from the truth.  Segregation has been over for 60 years- it is time for the black community to ask itself who their new *Heroes* are, and stop blaming others for the choices they make.",1

Metzger began his racist career in 1979 by patrolling the U.S./Mexican border in San Diego as a private citizen stating he was concerned about illegal immigration. 

When he began hosting a television show aimed at white nationalism, his anti-immigrant stance quickly became an anti-anything not white, Christian and male. Additionally, he sponsored a rock concert for Aryan youth which is how the Seraw killers were introduced to his racist gutter spewed antics.

This is, as usual, an exceptionally good round-up of well-written articles on events in parishes and events that affect parishes.  This is a help to me in keeping an awareness of how the big issues I so love to read and argue about get played out in real life settings.  

Juxtapose what happened in the first story (traditionalist priest causes turmoil in a not so conservative parish) and what we learn in the American Magazine article regarding the kinds of priests needed and the kind of training they need.  At seminaries, ""There has also been increasing emphasis on priestly identity and ministry, with seminarians taking courses separately from lay student ...hardly helping to prepare them for collaborative leadership when they are ordained...the 'cultic model' ...today’s seminarians are not being prepared to be spiritual guides, to give one-on-one spiritual direction or to guide people in prayer and discernment.""

It said 2% of Clinton’s statements it had reviewed were egregious “pants on fire” lies, compared with 19% of Trump’s. So Trump has nine times the share of flat-out lies as Clinton.

Likewise, The Washington Post Fact-Checker has awarded its worst ranking, Four Pinocchios, to 16% of Clinton’s statements that it checked and to 64% of Trump’s.

What all this means is that I stand to inherit a pile of money. Now look at my friend Warren, a black guy whose ancestors were just as hard working as mine. But his great grandparents were slaves, and after emancipation they were basically indentured servants. Local sheriff kept them from voting. His father served in WWII, but was prohibited from getting a mortgage. More after the jump.",1
"The problem with China is the case never goes to court. The plaintiffs find themselves in jail or on forced vacations.

"I totally understand Kathy Griffin. I only wish she hadn't retracted what she did. Now she needs to hold up a bloody earth, symbolizing the deaths that will occur in even greater numbers becayse if the serial killer in the White House. Ted Bundy has nothing on Trump.  He's graduated to Hitler status with this move. Next up: Nuclear war with Korea. 

Trump makes the whole world cringe, and shames our once great country.  As do the morons who put him in power. May they forever suffer because of their stupidity.",1
"""why were they not called out when the burned and looted Ferguson, and killed/ incited murdering police?""

Well, for starters, because they did neither of those things:
BLM didn't promote the killing of police officers and decried the rioting as well. The Dallas shooter wasn't a member and was thoroughly denounced. Antifa is definitely violent and deserves to be taken to account. They are still not even close to the white supremacists in terms of either rhetoric, action, or ideology. You're engaging in false-equivalence, whataboutism, and god knows what other fallacies.",1
"When a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?  When a chimp kills another chimp on Kinau Street, thereby saving taxpayers much money, is it worth prosecuting?  Send him back to the jungle and rejoice in knowing that Hawaii taxpayers are off the hook for hundreds of thousands of welfare dollars for this animal and its potential offspring.",0
"Exactly, like Kerry Gauthier -In August of 2012, he had sex with a 17 year old boy in a public bathroom, Barney Frank- Hired a male prostitute, ran a prostitution ring from his own home, Daniel Inouye   - Charged with sexual harassment against numerous women on his staff, Mel Reynolds - 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16 year old, David Wu - In 2011, had an affair with a minor, and friend of a campaign contributor - Arrested for soliciting sex of a minor?  Just like those guys........oh wait! They are  all social liberal democrats. oops.",0
"Ha ha! I stand corrected. I know I don't want to play any grammar games with you. I suspect it would be no contest for you. It's just that I hear so many grammatical transgressions from people who have not only completed high school but have college educations, that I'm somewhat aghast. So where does that leave me...at?
I guess the lesson I learned in my Modern English Grammar class taken decades ago is still germane. There is standard English grammar and many other English grammars. The point is to make yourself understood.",0

Ummmm...Ted Bundy was a white serial killer?!  

Next!",1
If the MSM was to cover this issue properly instead of focussing on only the sexy bits it would explain how these women actually got their cases to court. Prior workplace sexual harrassmnet cases were heard internally and often just resulted in the complainent losing her job; therefore not many cases came up and if they did they were dealt with quietly. Obama changed the rules so there was an open fair process which is how those little slugs Ailes and O'Reilly got caught. Trump has just quietly changed the rules back by executive order so you wont hear about too many more P.... grabbers because of the actions of the President P...Grabber.,0
"Kuroiwaj - You are fooling yourself.  There is no law that specifically says a person can't be prejudiced.  There is no law that specifically says a person has to treat everyone else equally.   Even if there are, there would be no way to prove/enforce them.   Do you really believe that blacks, asians, foreigners, handicapped, poor, ugly, muslims, buddhists, etc. were/are treated equally?  Wake up or open your eyes.",1

"ThomasPaine:  Thank you for this information.  Here's a wikepedia citation for those who might not believe you.: 

""The use of triple parentheses or triple brackets, also known as an (((echo))), is an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a Jewish background. The practice originated from the far-right blog The Right Stuff; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of members of the Jewish ethnicity had caused their surnames to ""echo throughout history"".[1] The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for online harassment, such as Jewish political journalists critical of President Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign.[2][3]""  

I agree with you that it constitutes overt anti-Semetism and should be removed.  Again, thank you for the information.  Gary Crum",0
"The difference here with what you purport and what Indigenous cultures are experiencing, is that the Indigenous peoples still suffer oppression at the hands of the Euro centric colonial system. All the groups you've cited are white, or could be identified as white, and would have integrated into the system over time based on that alone. No person of color will ever be able to join that club. Basically, society needs to be wholly re-made so that skin color is truly no longer a barrier to receiving the fruits of the current privilege afforded only to those that are identified as white.",1
