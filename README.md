# bias_module
This bias detection module reads user-defined comments our outputs from other AI systems and classifies if the text is racially biased or not. The model is trained on the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification dataset, which contains over 2 million biased comments, from subtle to explicit.
